Supported Build Platforms:

1.) Mac OSX
2.) Windows with Visual Studio 2005 (incomplete)

What does this environment does:
This clEnvironment API allows you to precompile your OpenCL kernels into
binaries then import them into you C/C++ code as statically defined arrays of
data which can then be re-used with the clCreateEnvironmentFromBins API. The
make system herein also forces the %.cl to %.h conversion to be a dependency
on the successful creation of your program/library/shared object. This means
that if your .cl files do not compile correctly you can not build your target,
thus pushing the run-time OpenCL build stages back into build-time builds. It
also allows you to completely specify a generic OpenCL Kernel call via predefined
structures, thus freeing you to not worry about how to queue/call/pass args/etc.

Compiling:

$ make clean
$ make

Testing:
$ make test

Installing:
$ export INSTALL_DIR=/where/ever/you/like
$ make install

What's contained herein:
1.) clEnvironment API
2.) clCompiler which utilizes the clEnvironment API
3.) clQuery which can extract lots of information about your local
    implementation of OpenCL.
4.) clYUV Kernel which can convert a YUV triplet of floats into/from RGB triplets
    of floats in 1 dimension.
5.) clPID Kernel (Proportional Integral and Derivative) control loop calculator.
6.) clImgFilter - Implements a 3x3 edge filter on input LUMA (B/W) images.
7.) clNBody - an implementation of the famous N-body gravity simulator.
